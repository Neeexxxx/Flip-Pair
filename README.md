## Continuous Deployment using AWS Code Pipeline and S3
  Create an S3 bucket for static website hosting, then create a continuous deployment pipeline (using AWS Code Pipeline) to automatically deploy the code whenever changes are made.

## The Game
A simple memory matching game.  The user clicks two cards (images of memes) to try to match them.  If there's a match, the cards disappear from the board.  If there's no match, the cards are flipped back to their blank side so the user can try again.

## The Deployment Environment
The code will be deployed and hosted in S3.

## The Deployment Pipeline
The pipeline is created using AWS Code Pipeline.  The pipeline pulls the code from GitHub, and deploys it to S3 whenever a change is detected in the code.

## Cost
All services used are eligible for the [AWS Free Tier].  However, charges will incur at some point so it's recommended that you shut down resources.
